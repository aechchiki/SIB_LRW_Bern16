# MinION lecture

Nice figure for MinION reads visualisation:

About 2D sequencing, in summary: 
- dsDNA molecule = ssDNA1(template) + ssDNA2 (complement)
- dsDNA adapters = loading adapter + hairpin adapter 
- 2D reads = "consensus". basecalling done using info from both ssDNA strands => more precision
(note: there is an option to filter high quality 2D reads only while generating fastq, see man 1.4.2)

TO DO: Ask Laurent Falquet if and what he will introduce about MinION. Maybe we need to introduce the technology
